PROJECT PROPOSAL: A UNIFIED CROSS-PLATFORM SOLUTION FOR REAL-TIME SERVICE RESERVATIONS

1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE

The service industry faces critical challenges in managing customer appointments efficiently. Traditional booking methods are inadequate for modern businesses and customers demanding convenience, real-time availability, and seamless digital experiences.

Key Problems:
• Fragmented booking systems leading to double bookings and poor customer experience
• Limited real-time capabilities causing customer frustration and business inefficiency
• Cross-platform inconsistency across devices and channels
• Scalability challenges with single-business focused solutions
• Geographic limitations preventing local businesses from reaching broader markets

Market Opportunity: The global online booking market is projected to reach $10.6 billion by 2025 (10.2% CAGR), driven by smartphone penetration, post-pandemic digital shift, and growing demand for contactless experiences (Martin, 2017).

Project Rationale: This project addresses the critical need for a unified, cross-platform solution that bridges service providers and customers, enabling real-time availability, instant confirmations, and scalable multi-business support.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

7. PROJECT PLAN

The project plan demonstrates the feasibility of the BUKKi cross-platform booking solution and provides concrete work breakdown to achieve successful completion within the available time and resources. The plan applies project management techniques from CS5002 - Software Engineering, CC5006 - Project Management, and CC5004 - Security in Computing modules.

7.1 PROJECT WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)

The project objectives have been refined using the SMART technique (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-related) and broken down into 4 main areas, each containing 2-3 activities with estimated durations of 2-3 weeks per activity.

**Table 1: The project WBS activities**

7.3 PROJECT ACTIVITY SEQUENCING

While the WBS estimates individual activity durations, activity sequencing determines the logical, temporal sequence between activities. The following sequencing has been established:

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Literature Search → Literature Review (cannot start before completion)
- Requirements Analysis → System Architecture Design (sequential dependency)
- Database Implementation → Backend API Development (sequential dependency)
- Frontend Development → QR Code Integration (sequential dependency)
- Backend API Development → Payment System Integration (sequential dependency)

**Parallel Activities:**
- Requirements Analysis can run parallel with Literature Review
- Security Implementation can run parallel with Backend API Development
- Documentation and Deployment can run parallel with Testing and QA
- User Acceptance Testing can start after core testing completion

**Critical Path:**
Literature Search → Literature Review → Requirements Analysis → System Architecture Design → Database Implementation → Backend API Development → Frontend Development → Payment Integration → Testing and QA → User Acceptance Testing → Final Report
