<h1>BUKKi Booking Platform - Project Report</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The current appointment booking landscape is highly fragmented, requiring customers to manage multiple applications while imposing significant barriers on small businesses seeking digital solutions. This project presents <strong>BUKKi</strong>, a centralized cross-platform booking management system consolidating appointment scheduling across multiple service industries into a unified mobile and web application.</p>

<p>Developed using React 18 with Capacitor, NestJS, and PostgreSQL, the platform implements intelligent conflict-free booking with real-time availability checks, geospatial discovery, integrated messaging, secure Stripe payment processing, and verified review systems. The development followed an Agile-inspired methodology spanning 20 weeks across four phases, emphasizing performance optimization through strategic database indexing achieving 10-100x query speedup and API pagination for scalability.</p>

<p>The resulting system achieves sub-200ms API response times, supports geospatial queries within 100ms for 100,000+ businesses, and maintains zero double-booking incidents. Security features include JWT authentication, role-based access control, and field-level encryption. The production-ready platform is deployable across iOS, Android, and web, democratizing digital booking technology for small businesses while providing customers with a seamless unified experience.</p>

<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>

<h3>1.1 Project Topic and Rationale</h3>

<p>This project presents <strong>BUKKi</strong>, a centralized cross-platform booking management system that consolidates appointment scheduling across multiple service industries into a unified mobile and web application. The platform serves both service providers and customers, facilitating seamless booking experiences for restaurants, beauty salons, fitness centers, healthcare facilities, and other service-based businesses.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this project stems from the fragmented nature of current booking solutions. Customers must navigate multiple applications for different services—one for restaurant reservations, another for salon appointments, and a third for fitness classes. This fragmentation creates significant challenges: poor user experience from managing multiple platforms, high operational costs for small businesses to implement digital booking systems, and market inefficiency preventing easy service comparison and discovery.</p>

<p>The core problem this project addresses is the <strong>absence of a unified, scalable, and cost-effective booking platform</strong> that can serve multiple industries while providing a single application for customers, low-barrier entry for small businesses, real-time availability management, integrated communication channels, and comprehensive analytics capabilities.</p>

<p>This project is valuable both technologically and commercially. It tackles complex technical challenges including real-time synchronization across iOS, Android, and web platforms, scalable database architecture supporting high-concurrency operations, geospatial search for location-based discovery, and secure payment processing integration. The business value lies in democratizing access to digital booking technology, enabling small businesses to compete without significant capital investment.</p>

<p>Key technical challenges include maintaining database performance at scale with sub-second query times for hundreds of thousands of records, ensuring cross-platform consistency using React and Capacitor, preventing double-bookings through optimistic locking and transaction isolation, implementing field-level encryption for sensitive data, and building reliable payment workflows with asynchronous webhook handling.</p>

<h3>1.2 Project Aims and Objectives</h3>

<p><strong>Primary Aim:</strong> To develop a production-ready, cross-platform centralized booking management system that reduces booking friction for customers and lowers the technological barrier for service businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Key Objectives:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Platform Development:</strong> Design and implement a full-stack application using React, NestJS, and PostgreSQL deployable on iOS, Android, and web platforms.</li>

<li><strong>Business Management System:</strong> Create comprehensive onboarding enabling business owners to configure services, hours, pricing, and profiles independently.</li>

<li><strong>Intelligent Booking Engine:</strong> Implement conflict-free booking with real-time availability checks, automated confirmations, recurring appointments, and waitlist management achieving zero double-bookings and sub-500ms response times.</li>

<li><strong>Discovery and Search:</strong> Develop geospatial search with radius-based filtering, category search, and map visualization returning results within 100ms for 100,000+ businesses.</li>

<li><strong>Communication Infrastructure:</strong> Build integrated messaging with automated notifications achieving 99% delivery rate and real-time synchronization.</li>

<li><strong>Trust System:</strong> Implement reviews and ratings with verified reviews, spam prevention, and transparent reputation metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Payment Integration:</strong> Integrate Stripe for PCI-compliant payment processing with webhook handling and automated booking confirmations.</li>

<li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimize through database indexing, pagination, and caching ensuring sub-200ms API response times at 95th percentile under load.</li>

<li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Implement JWT authentication, role-based access control, field-level encryption, and audit logging passing OWASP Top 10 assessment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>1.3 Methodology</h3>

<p>The project followed an <strong>Agile-inspired iterative methodology</strong> with elements of the Rational Unified Process, structured across four phases:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1: Inception</strong> (2 weeks) - Market research, requirements elicitation, technology selection, and initial architecture design producing the system architecture diagram and database Entity-Relationship Diagram.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2: Elaboration</strong> (3 weeks) - Detailed system design, API contract definition using OpenAPI, database normalization, UI wireframing, and security architecture design.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3: Construction</strong> (12 weeks in 3 iterations) - Iterative development of core infrastructure (authentication, user management), business and booking features (service management, booking engine, calendar UI), and advanced features (geospatial search, reviews, messaging, payments, notifications). Development practices included Git version control with feature branches, ESLint/Prettier for code quality, incremental database migrations, and Swagger API documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4: Transition</strong> (3 weeks) - Performance optimization through database indexing (Migration 010 achieving 10-100x speedup), API pagination implementation, load testing, security audit, and deployment preparation.</p>

<p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong> Backend uses NestJS with TypeORM and PostgreSQL; frontend uses React 18 with Capacitor for mobile deployment; additional integrations include Stripe for payments, Firebase for push notifications, and Leaflet for mapping.</p>

<h3>1.4 Report Structure</h3>
